            <h2>Test 3</h2>
            <p>Perhaps in the future, a websites backend code would be encrypted and unreachabled
            by users, thus seemingly putting an end to clone phishing. But this test will prove that
            even if one can't simply copy/paste code, cloning websites is still fairly doable.

        <div id="exp">
            <h2>How it's Made</h2>
            <p>Although it may seem obvious, every website IS what the webpage displays. To the 
            average user, if a website essentially looks the exact same to another, even if the 
            backend code is different, the user will think it is the same website. It may seem tedious,
            but an exact copy of any website can be made by hand, as long as it is visible to the user.
            This can be done with any page on the world wide web, such as with the official DOE login below, 
            which some viewers may be familiar with:
            </p>
            <br>
            <img id="standardimg" src="Images/officialdoe.png" alt="Error">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            And that is what I have exactly done here. Without directly copying the websites code, I created a
            clone of the DOE login website by hand. This took considerably longer than the first two tests.
            It is a close and faithful copy yet hold them side by side
            and the differences are obvious.
