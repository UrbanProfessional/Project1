            <h2>How it's Made</h2>
            <p>Most should be familiar with the average phishing email with some reward or verification
            that involves entering financial information. Of course, if one were to enter such info,
            the phisher would then have access to their private funds. Sadly, many people, especially the elderly,
            fall for these attack. Below are several examples of said emails:
            </p>
            <br>
            <div id="grid">
                <img id="gridimg" src="Images/grid1.png" alt="Error">
                <img id="gridimg" src="Images/grid2.png" alt="Error">
                <img id="gridimg" src="Images/grid3.png" alt="Error">
                <img id="gridimg" src="Images/grid4.png" alt="Error">
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            In the spirit of the ordinary, I have created a copy of the <a href="https://www.chase.com/">Chase Bank</a>
            login page. Financial services are some of the most common to be inpersonated in phishing emails. Phishing
            like this is usually encountered on a daily basis.
