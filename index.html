            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>To the phishing education emporium. In this webpage you will learn and see
            many useful things about the digital problem of phishing. </p>
            <p>First and foremost, what is phishing?</p>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Well, phishing, as the word might hint, is the act of luring users into interacting with 
            malicious elements such as fake login pages. It usually involves a standard email in one's inbox.
            Depending on the skill of the phisher, said email may look like any other confirmation or notice. 
            Such as with the suspicious email below which arrived in my inbox during making of this article:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img id="standardimg" src="Images/phish1.png" alt="Error">
            <br>
            <br>
            One possible way for this email to be structured, and what this article covers, is clone phishing.
            <br>
